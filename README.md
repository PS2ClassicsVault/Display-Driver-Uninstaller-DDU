# Display Driver Uninstaller DDU
This utility is widely used by PC enthusiasts and technicians for completely removing graphics drivers and related files when switching between GPUs or troubleshooting driver issues. The new release focuses on improving driver cleanup, especially for AMD hardware, and includes some important fixes for Windows configurations.

Requirement:
-Windows 7 SP1 up to Windows 11 (anything higher is at your own risk)
-NVIDIA, AMD, Intel GPUs
-Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 or higher

Recommended usage:
-You MUST disconnect your internet or completely block Windows Update when running DDU until you have re-installed your new drivers.
-DDU should be used when having a problem uninstalling / installing a driver or when switching GPU brand.
-DDU should not be used every time you install a new driver unless you know what you are doing.
-The tool can be used in Normal mode but for absolute stability when using DDU, Safemode is always the best.
-If you are using DDU in normal mode, Clean, reboot, clean again, reboot.
-Make a backup or a system restore (but it should normally be pretty safe).
-It is best to exclude the DDU folder completely from any security software to avoid issues.
-If you encounter issues, read the "Issues and solutions.txt"
